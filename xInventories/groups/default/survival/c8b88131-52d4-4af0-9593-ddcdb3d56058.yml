        §0RE: Complaints§0
        §0
        §0I received a complaint from GDE about last night (May 5) regarding Officers jailing a lot of people.
      - "I take responsibility for not being clear as to how I want you to perform\
        \ your duties. Im not singling anyone out. §0\n§0\n§0I just want the following\
        \ to take place moving forward.§0\n§0\n§0(1) You MUST provide proof. When\
        \ you arrest someone go to the "
      - |
        supply cabinet, grab a notebook, and fill it out. I want to know why you arrested someone, what they did wrong, what rule they broke, how many warnings they were given and I want proof as to what they did.§0
        §0
        §0What is proof?:§0
      - |-
        So we are clear: proof is anything I can verify. Screenshots are great and can be uploaded online. Copy the URL of the photo and paste it into your notes so I can see it.§0
        §0
        §0If something can't be screenshotted like hacking or what not. Then I need witn
      - |-
        Make sure to include a list of players that witnessed the event. 1 is fine, more is better.§0
        §0
        §0Have them attend the Police Office and give them a notebook in the interview room.§0
        §0
        §0Have them write a quick statement verifying your accusation.
      - |-
        Have them sign and close it. Submit it with your evidence. §0
        §0
        §0So next time GDE asks me why a bunch of people were jailed I can go to him with proof and tell him why.§0
        §0
        §0(2) Sergeants are no longer excempt from the rules and they cannot make up rul
      - "anymore. Right now there are only 3 rules. It is every officers duty to know\
        \ what they are. Don't know? Then visit the rules room outside the Police\
        \ Office.§0\n§0\n§0Only rules found here can be enforced. If you have a suggestion\
        \ for a rule then submit tell "
      - "Remember when you jail someone they are out of the game for 30 minutes, probably\
        \ longer because they are stupid and will prolong their jail visit unneccassarily.§\
        0\n§0\n§0(3) If GDE tells you to Jail someone then go ahead and Arrest them.\
        \ The only thing you "
      - |-
        fill out is that you arrested someone and GDE told you to. Doesn't have to be a rule. If he says jail them, jail them.§0
        §0
        §0(4) If I am unable to find proof then I will start punishing the Officers through fining them money, possible jail sentence, or fi
      - |-
        (5) Warnings: Personally I think 3 is more than enough. I'm good with 1 warning. 1-3 is fair. Use your own discretion.§0
        §0
        §0You don't have to give them 3.§0
        §0
        §0(6) Don't act like an idiot in the office.
      - "(7) Don't go into areas your not supposed to go.§0\n§0\n§0(8) Do not allow\
        \ non members of the Police service into the station.§0\n§0\n§0(9) If your\

        mailbox and I need a quick note with your blessing in my mailbox.§0
        §0
        §0If the application has the questions missing and just the answers then its as good as garbage and I wont read it.§0
        §0
        §0I don't need everyone in the server to work for us.
      - |-
        I need people that play a lot, are respectable, on at different times, and can enforce rules respectfully. §0
        §0
        §0Its a real role. §0

        §0Thanks for all your hard work thus far.§0
